                        A Powdery Surface Is Closely Explored

                    <p>Houston, Monday, July 21--Men have landed and walked on the moon.</p>
                    <p>Two Americans, astronauts of Apollo 11, steered their fragile four-legged lunar module
                        safely
                        and smoothly to the historic landing yesterday at 4:17:40 P.M., Eastern daylight time.
                    </p>

                    <p>Neil A. Armstrong, the 38-year-old civilian commander, radioed to earth and the mission
                        control
                        room here:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first men to reach the moon--Mr. Armstrong and his co-pilot, Col. Edwin E. Aldrin,
                        Jr. of
                        the Air Force--brought their ship to rest on a level, rock-strewn plain near the
                        southwestern
                        shore of the arid Sea of Tranquility.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        About six and a half hours later, Mr. Armstrong opened the landing craft's hatch,
                        stepped
                        slowly down the ladder and declared as he planted the first human footprint on the
                        lunar
                        crust:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
                    </p>

                    <p>His first step on the moon came at 10:56:20 P.M., as a television camera outside the
                        craft
                        transmitted his every move to an awed and excited audience of hundreds of millions of
                        people on
                        earth.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tentative Steps Test Soil
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mr. Armstrong's initial steps were tentative tests of the lunar soil's firmness and of
                        his
                        ability to move about easily in his bulky white spacesuit and backpacks and under the
                        influence
                        of lunar gravity, which is one-sixth that of the earth.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "The surface is fine and powdery," the astronaut reported. "I can pick it up loosely
                        with my
                        toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my
                        boots. I
                        only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch. But I can see the
                        footprints of my boots in the treads in the fine sandy particles.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After 19 minutes of Mr. Armstrong's testing, Colonel Aldrin joined him outside the
                        craft.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The two men got busy setting up another television camera out from the lunar module,
                        planting
                        an American flag into the ground, scooping up soil and rock samples, deploying
                        scientific
                        experiments and hopping and loping about in a demonstration of their lunar agility.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And people back on earth found the black-and-white television pictures of the bug-
                        shaped
                        lunar
                        module and the men tramping about it so sharp and clear as to seem unreal, more like a
                        toy
                        and
                        toy-like figures than human beings on the most daring and
                        far- reaching expedition thus
                        far
                        undertaken.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During one break in the astronauts' work, President Nixon congratulated them from the
                        White
                        House in what, he said, "certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever
                        made."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Because of what you have done," the President told the astronauts, "the heavens have
                        become
                        a
                        part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility it required us
                        to
                        redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to earth.

                        "For one priceless moment in the whole history of man all the people on this earth are

                    <p>
                        Mr. Armstrong replied:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Thank you Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here

                        men with a vision for the future."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mr. Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin returned to their landing craft and
                        closed the hatch at 1:12
                        A.M., 2 hours 21 minutes after opening the hatch on the moon. While the
                        third member of the
                        crew, Lieut. Col. Michael Collins of the Air Force, kept his orbital vigil
                        overhead in the
                        command ship, the two moon explorers settled down to sleep.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Outside their vehicle the astronauts had found a bleak world.
                        It was just before dawn,
                        with
                        the
                        sun low over the eastern horizon behind them and the chill
                        of the long lunar nights
                        still
                        clinging to the boulders, small craters and hills before them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Colonel Aldrin said that he could see "literally thousands
                        of small craters" and a low
                        hill
                        out
                        in the distance. But most of all he was impressed initially
                        by the "variety of shapes,
                        angularities, granularities" of the rocks and soil where the
                        landing craft, code-named
                        Eagle
                        had set down.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The landing was made four miles west of the aiming point,
                        but well within the
                        designated
                        area.
                        An apparent error in some data fed into the craft's guidance
                        computer from the earth
                        was
                        said
                        to have accounted for the discrepancy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Suddenly the astronauts were startled to see that the
                        computer was guiding them toward
                        a
                        possibly disastrous touchdown in a boulder-filled
                        crater about the size of a football
                        field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mr. Armstrong grabbed manual control of the vehicle
                        and guided it safely over the
                        crater to
                        a
                        smoother spot, the rocket engine stirring a cloud of
                        moon dust during the final seconds
                        of
                        descent.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Soon after the landing, upon checking and finding the
                        spacecraft in good condition, Mr.
                        Armstrong and Colonel Aldrin made their decision to
                        open the hatch and get out earlier
                        than
                        originally scheduled. The flight plan had called for
                        the moon walk to begin at 2:12
                        A.M.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Flight controllers here said that the early moon walk
                        would not mean that the
                        astronauts
                        would
                        also leave the moon earlier. The lift-off is scheduled
                        to come at about 1:55 P.M.
                        today.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Their departure from the landing craft out onto the
                        surface was delayed for a time when
                        they
                        had trouble depressurizing the cabin so that they
                        could open the hatch. All the oxygen
                        in
